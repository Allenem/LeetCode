    "The covariance matrix is a fundamental concept in statistics, illustrating how much two random variables change together. It's essential for understanding the relationships between variables in a dataset. For a dataset with $n$ features, the covariance matrix is an $n \\times n$ square matrix where each element (i, j) represents the covariance between the $i$-th and $j$-th features. Covariance is defined by the formula:\n",

    "- $x_i$ and $y_i$ are individual observations of $X$ and $Y$,\n",
    "- $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are the means of $X$ and $Y$,\n",
    "- $n$ is the number of observations.\n",
    "- The diagonal elements (where $i = j$) indicate the variance of each feature.\n",
    "- The off-diagonal elements show the covariance between different features. \n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix is symmetric, as the covariance between $X$ and $Y$ is equal to the covariance between $Y$ and $X$, denoted as $\\text{cov}(X, Y) = \\text{cov}(Y, X)$."
