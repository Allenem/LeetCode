    "# Implement Orthogonal Projection of a Vector onto a Line\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Task: Compute the Orthogonal Projection of a Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement a function that calculates the orthogonal projection of a vector v onto another vector L. This projection results in the vector on L that is closest to v.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function orthogonal_projection(v, L) that takes in two lists, v (the vector to be projected) and L (the line vector), and returns the orthogonal projection of v onto L. The function should output a list representing the projection vector rounded to three decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "v = [3, 4]\n",
    "L = [1, 0]\n",
    "print(orthogonal_projection(v, L))\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "[3.0, 0.0]\n",
    "Reasoning:\n",
    "The orthogonal projection of vector [3, 4] onto the line defined by [1, 0] results in the projection vector [3, 0], which lies on the line [1, 0].\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Orthogonal Projection in Vector Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Orthogonal projection is a fundamental concept in linear algebra, used to project one vector onto another. The projection of vector $v$ onto a line defined by vector $L$ results in a new vector that lies on $L$, representing the closest point to $v$ on that line. This can be thought of as $v$'s shadow on $L$ if a light was shown directly down on $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To project a vector $v$ onto a non-zero vector $L$ in space, we calculate the scalar projection of $v$ onto the unit vector of $L$, which represents the magnitude of the projection. The resulting projection vector lies along the direction of $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any vector $v$ in Cartesian space, the orthogonal projection onto $L$ is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{proj}_L(v) = \\frac{v \\cdot L}{L \\cdot L} \\cdot L$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $v$ is the vector being projected,\n",
    "- $L$ is the vector defining the line of projection,\n",
    "- $v \\cdot L$ is the dot product of $v$ and $L$,\n",
    "- $L \\cdot L$ is the dot product of $L$ with itself, which gives the magnitude squared of $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting projection vector lies along the direction of $L$ and represents the component of $v$ that is parallel to $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, the projection of a vector $v$ onto a unit vector $\\hat{L}$ (the normalized version of $L$) simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{proj}_{\\hat{L}}(v) = (v \\cdot \\hat{L}) \\cdot \\hat{L}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of Orthogonal Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "Orthogonal projection has a wide range of applications across various fields in mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering. Some of the most common applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computer Graphics**: In 3D rendering, orthogonal projections are used to create 2D views of 3D objects. This projection helps in reducing dimensional complexity and displaying models from different angles.\n",
    "2. **Data Science and Machine Learning**: In high-dimensional data, projection methods are used to reduce dimensions (e.g., Principal Component Analysis) by projecting data onto lower-dimensional subspaces, helping with data visualization and reducing computational complexity."
